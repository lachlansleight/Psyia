# Psyia
GPU Particle System for the HTC Vive

This is the complete repository with all branches for the cancelled project 'Psyia'.
For an explanation of why this is here, please have a read of [this post](https://www.lachlansleight.com/2019/07/02/psyia-is-cancelled/).

Open the project in the Unity 2018.3.0f2 and check out the scene 'StarLab'. Everything should be largely functional. Feel free to create an Issue if you'd like to ask me any questions about how anything works - I'm open sourcing this as a learning resource so if I can help without spending tons of time, I will. :)
